# Introduction 
This is the project repository of the paper:  
Human-in-the-loop Learning for Adaptive Robot Manipulation using Large Language Models and Behavior Trees  

We use ArUco markers and OpenCV 3.2.0 for camera calibration and recognition.  
Refer to https://github.com/kyle-bersani/opencv-examples  

You can refer to the MPs.xml file to compile the manipulation primitives for your manipulator.
