You need to design the action knowledge for robot.
There are some available conditions can be Pre-condition and Post-condition of an action:
IsGripperEmpty, IsApproach(object), IsOpened(object), IsOn(object,table)
The variables in brackets are parameters.
You can create conditional predicates to make reasonable requests if necessary.

The demonstration examples are showed in Database.xml
The manipulation primitives are showed in MPs.xml

Only generate the same format as in the case without explanation.
